#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Dietary fructose enhances tumor growth indirectly via interorgan lipid transfer
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Fructose consumption has increased considerably over the past five decades,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	largely due to the widespread use of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as a
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	sweetener. It has been proposed that fructose promotes the growth of some tumors
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	by serving as a direct fuel. Here, we show that fructose supplementation
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	enhances tumor growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer, and cervical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cancer without causing weight gain or insulin resistance. Interestingly, the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cancer cells themselves were unable to use fructose readily as a nutrient
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	because they did not express ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C). Primary hepatocytes did
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	express KHK-C, resulting in fructolysis and the excretion of a variety of lipid
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	species, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). In co-culture experiments,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hepatocyte-derived LPCs were consumed by cancer cells and used to generate
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	phosphatidylcholines (PCs), the major phospholipid of cell membranes. In vivo,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	HFCS supplementation increased several LPC species by &gt;7-fold in serum.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Administration of LPCs to mice was sufficient to increase tumor growth.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Pharmacological inhibition of ketohexokinase had no direct effect on cancer
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cells, but it decreased circulating LPC levels and prevented fructose-mediated
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	tumor growth in vivo. These findings reveal that fructose supplementation
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	increases circulating nutrients such as LPCs, which can enhance tumor growth
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	through a cell non-autonomous mechanism.

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Hepatocytes transform fructose into polar metabolites that are selectively
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	utilized by cancer cells
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	The goal of this project was to determine if hepatocytes can metabolically
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	transform fructose into polar metabolites that CaSki cancer cells can uptake and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	metabolize. The CaSki cells do not metabolize fructose directly to much extent,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	but the liver robustly metabolizes fructose. Therefore, we cultured primary
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice in [U-13C] fructose as the only sugar source for
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	24 hours to form hepatocyte-conditioned media. We then transferred this media to
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	CaSki cells for 24 hours to form CaSki-conditioned media. LC-MS profiling of
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	polar 13C-labeled metabolites of hepatocyte-conditioned media and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	CaSki-conditioned media revealed that 13C-labeled glucose and 13C-labeled
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	aspartate are released from hepatocytes and are up taken by CaSki cells.
